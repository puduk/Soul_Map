## ✍️ Content Credits

- All code and logic are original and written by the developer.
- However, some of the **test questions** and **string-based content** (like result messages, prompts, etc.) were **assisted by ChatGPT (OpenAI)** during brainstorming and generation.
- This helped speed up the creative process while keeping the final implementation fully customized and original.
